# Customer_Retention_Analysis

PWC Switzerland Virtual Internship Task 2

As a part of the PWC Switzerland Virtual Internship Program offered by Forage, I have created "CustomerRetention Analysis" dashboard using Power BI. 
The Telecommuniation data contains attributes such as:
customerID, gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents, tenure, PhoneService, MultipleLines, TechSupport, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies, Contract, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges, numAdminTickets, numTechTickets, Churn(Yes/No).

# üìä Objective

The goal is to provide actionable insights to better understand customer behavior and factors influencing churn. Through visualizations and analytics, the dashboard aims to identify patterns, trends, and potential risk factors associated with customer churn, enabling proactive strategies to mitigate churn and improve customer retention.


# üë©‚Äçüè≠Findings

1) Demographics Analysis:

 * Visualize customer churn based on demographic factors such as gender, senior citizen status, partner, and dependents.
 * Identify any demographic segments that exhibit higher churn rates, enabling targeted retention strategies.

2) Customer Account Information:

 * Analyze the relationship between tenure and churn rate to understand the impact of customer longevity on churn behavior.
 * Explore the influence of services such as phone service, multiple lines, tech support, streaming TV, and streaming movies on churn propensity.

3) Churn Rate Analysis:

* Calculate and visualize the overall churn rate to assess the health of customer retention efforts.
* Examine churn rate trends over time to identify any significant changes or seasonality in churn behavior.

4) Loyalty and Churn Rate:

* Investigate the relationship between customer loyalty (measured by tenure) and churn rate to determine if longer-tenured customers are more loyal and less likely to churn.

5) Churn Rate by Contract Type:

* Compare churn rates across different contract types (e.g., month-to-month, one-year, two-year contracts) to understand the impact of contract duration on churn behavior.
* Identify which contract types are associated with higher churn rates and explore potential reasons for churn within each contract category.

6) Churn Risk Analysis:

* Analyze the distribution of monthly charges among churned customers to identify any pricing-related factors contributing to churn risk.
* Assess the relationship between monthly charges and churn rate to determine if there are pricing thresholds that influence churn behavior.



  
By synthesizing these findings, stakeholders can gain a comprehensive understanding of customer churn dynamics and develop targeted retention strategies to minimize churn, enhance customer loyalty, and optimize business performance.
